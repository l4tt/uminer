# uminer
uminer is a project i made to crack BTC, and ETH wallet's using there private keys. I made this to show it was possible to crack crypto wallets and show there is always a free way in making money, do note there is timeouts and if it's timing out multiple times the IP has been banned for 30m, so please run this on a proxychain or something that switches multiple IP's, you can get alot of hit's on the first pages but it will slowly take awhile to get more so recommended to be on a VPS. ALSO THIS ONLY WORKS ON LINUX!!! because the privkey gen was compiled for unix in GOLANG. json results are saved in the assets folder.
